# Three Flows Compliance - Process Flowchart

**Layout**: Left-to-Right / Merging
**Style**: Blueprint (Technical schematic, CAD-like precision)

**STEPS**:

1. **Source Flows (Left)**: Three parallel tracks:
   - "物流 (Logistics)": Icons of cargo, truck, warehouse.
   - "资金流 (Capital)": Icons of currency, bank, transaction.
   - "商流 (Commercial)": Icons of contract, signature, promise.
2. **Aggregation Point (Center)**: A complex node labeled "数字化应用 / 信息流 (Information Flow)".
3. **Data Artifacts (Right)**: Three linked documents outputting from the center:
   - "订单 (Order)"
   - "支付单 (Payment)"
   - "渠道单 (Channel Order)"

**CONNECTIONS**:

- Smooth technical lines merging from the parallel flows into the central hub.
- Precise dashed lines connecting the resulting documents to emphasize their "一一匹配 (Exact Match)" relationship.

**STYLE**: blueprint, engineering diagram, technical drawing, schematic, blue background with white geometric lines, precise scale marks, architectural font.
**ASPECT**: 16:9
**LANGUAGE**: Chinese
